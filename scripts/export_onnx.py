    """Write an INT8 weight-only dynamically quantized copy of `model_path`.

    Dynamic quantization converts the weights of every `MatMul` (the attention and MLP linear
    layers) to int8 while leaving activations in fp32; the activation scale is computed per input
    at run time, so no calibration dataset is needed. The graph structure and the input/output
    names are unchanged, which is what lets `ONNXAgent` load the result by pointing `onnx_path` at
    it. It is CPU-only: ONNX Runtime has no INT8 MatMul kernel on the CUDAExecutionProvider, so an
    int8 graph on GPU falls back to CPU.

    `per_channel` defaults to **False** (one scale per weight tensor). Per-channel scales are a
    static/QDQ feature; on the dynamic `MatMulInteger` path the per-channel weight scale does not
    combine correctly with the per-input activation scale, and on the real checkpoints it collapses
    the decision model (measured: the English ModernBERT-large agreed with the eager Agent on only
    31/96 held-out choice decisions at `per_channel=True` vs 64/96 at `per_channel=False`; the
    multilingual mmBERT was 40% vs 83%). See issue #790.

    INT8 is a size/latency option, not a free one. On CPU it is roughly 2x faster than eager and
    ~1.8x faster than the fp32 ONNX graph, and 1.4-2.8x smaller, but even at `per_channel=False` it
    trades real accuracy (the drift above is substantial, and worse on the larger checkpoint): do
    not use it where the calibrated probability or confidence matters. Accuracy-safe int8 for this
    model would need QAT or SmoothQuant-style outlier handling, not an export-time flag.
