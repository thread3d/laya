/**
 * The design page's request contract must be the contract the client implements.
 *
 * `docs/typescript-sdk.md` is the wire reference for callers who read the design doc instead of the
 * guide, and its control paragraph had drifted into a positive lie: it said `/v1/systemone` does not
 * expose `task` and `lang` and that the SDK rejects those options, while `body()` had long been
 * forwarding them (and `lang_guess`, `max_len`, `head_max_len`, `min_confidence` besides). A caller who
 * believed the page would keep paying server-side defaults it could have overridden.
 *
 * So the page is read through the same seam a server sees: the options are set, the request body the
 * client hands to `fetch` is captured, and the table is compared against the keys that were really put
 * on the wire. Nothing here transcribes the client's option list -- if `body()` gains or drops a control
 * the table has to move with it, in both directions.
