# Research

Benchmark harnesses and raw results for the Laya checkpoints. This branch is the evidence behind
the numbers quoted in the main README — nothing here is imported by the `laya` package.

## Evaluation

- [`eval/`](eval/README.md): the independent per-language MASSIVE harness (`laya_eval.py`), the per-case
  report behind the published numbers, plus the metamorphic and presentation checks.
- [`evals/`](evals/README.md): the labelled datasets, thresholds and regression gate consumed by
  `laya.evals` / `laya-evals` and the scheduled `evals` workflow.

## Community diagnostics

- [Chinese workplace decisions (Feishu-style)](benchmarks/feishu_zh/README.md) — 64 synthetic scenarios, paired recorded Laya/Jev responses, English/Chinese cards, and a model-free audit. [中文入口](benchmarks/feishu_zh/README.zh-CN.md). Start with `python research/benchmarks/feishu_zh/audit.py`; no downloads or API keys required. This is a contributed historical snapshot, separate from the upstream sweeps below.
- [Chinese short-command routing](benchmarks/zh_short_commands/README.md) — 18 frozen Chinese voice commands, a seven-rung ablation of the documented prompt guidance on both the six-way `choice` path and the four-question `noul` path, and every per-case decision archived. [中文入口](benchmarks/zh_short_commands/README.zh-CN.md). Start with `python research/benchmarks/zh_short_commands/audit.py`; the audit needs no downloads and the archive records which weights produced the numbers.

## Scripts

| file | what it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/laya_benchmark_colab.ipynb` | the full head-to-head on a Colab T4: typed-decisions, MASSIVE intent + scenario (14 languages), XNLI (15), English suites, latency, option-order robustness, calibration repair. Writes one JSON. |
| `scripts/build_benchmark_nb.py` | generator for that notebook (edit here, not the `.ipynb`) |
| `scripts/bench_local.py` | CPU sweep: MASSIVE intent across **all 51 languages**, plus typed-decisions on all three checkpoints |
| `scripts/bench_apps.py` | the six application workflows (support triage, email + phishing, guardrails, RAG relevance, moderation, model routing) plus the datasets where public Jev numbers exist |
| `scripts/bench_latency.py` | inference speed including what routing costs: detection overhead, hot path, cold-swap, mixed-language throughput at several `max_loaded` settings |
| `scripts/bench_length_batching.py` | compare upstream contiguous batches with optional length sorting on synthetic tickets, including output consistency and optional fresh-process memory profiles (`psutil` required for memory mode) |
| `scripts/bench_nvidia_capacity.py` | `laya` as a dynamically batched HTTP service on one NVIDIA GPU: open-loop Poisson sweep to the highest rate meeting a p99 SLO, 24-hour curve replay, and the ONNX export the TensorRT rows need (TensorRT via ONNX Runtime, not a laya backend). Results: `results/nvidia_capacity_20260925.json` |
| `scripts/make_plots.py` | renders `assets/laya_benchmark.png` from the result JSONs |
| `scripts/bench_long_context.py` | `laya-multilingual` on long documents: 20 support requests in 8 languages, each placed after 0 to 7,000 tokens of unrelated text, scored at the default limit and at `max_len=8192` |
| `scripts/bench_position_sensitivity.py` | the same 20 requests, filler and question, with the request swept *through* a fixed-length document instead of only appended to it, so the effect of evidence **position** is separable from document **length** |
| `scripts/plot_long_context.py` | renders `assets/long_context_8192.png` from `results/long_context_multilingual.json` |

Everything runs with `USE_TF=0` — `transformers` probes for TensorFlow at import, and when TF is
installed its abseil runtime can deadlock model construction on macOS/Python 3.9.

## Running the harnesses

The checkpoints come from `LAYA_MODELS` (default `~/laya_models`, a directory holding `laya/`,
`laya-multilingual/` and `laya-typed-decisions/`), so a plain checkout can point them at the
models `setup_laya.sh` already downloaded as a local `models/` copy:

```bash
# from the repository root
LAYA_MODELS=$PWD/models python research/scripts/bench_local.py --langs 10 --per-lang 60 --skip-b
LAYA_MODELS=$PWD/models BENCH_N=80 python research/scripts/bench_apps.py
LAYA_MODELS=$PWD/models python research/scripts/bench_latency.py
```

| option | effect |
|---|---|
| `bench_local.py --langs N` | caps the language list (sorted, so `10` is the first ten codes; `0` = all 51) |
| `bench_local.py --per-lang N` | cases per language (default 120) |
| `bench_local.py --skip-a` / `--skip-b` | run only the typed-decisions half, or only the MASSIVE half |
| `bench_apps.py` with `BENCH_N` | cases per application suite (default 400) |

`bench_local.py` and `bench_apps.py` write `research/*_benchmark_results.json`, which is
gitignored — the curated runs live in `results/`. Set `HF_HOME` inside the checkout to keep the
dataset cache local.

`bench_local.py` and `bench_latency.py` take the model root from `LAYA_MODELS` rather than
assuming `~/laya_models`, and their `sys.path` entry points at the repository root rather than a
directory that does not exist, so they run from a plain checkout that keeps its weights under
`models/`. Results from a reduced CPU re-run, and the two figures that match the published numbers
exactly, are in [`BENCHMARKS.md`](../BENCHMARKS.md#independent-reproduction-macos-intel-cpu-only).

## Length batching

[Local CPU measurements](results/length_batching_cpu_20260924.json) compare the original
`predict_batch` method at `1e28ac20c0896b1c37a744cd11f740eb98f8b178` with `sort_by_length=True`.
On 10,000 synthetic English support tickets, the multilingual checkpoint took **1775.71 s
before and 825.09 s after (2.15x)**, including tokenization, collation, inference and decoding.
There were zero choice/action decision changes, zero usage mismatches, and a maximum returned
numeric difference of **0.0001**. This is a throughput workload, not a labeled accuracy test.

The machine was a Ryzen 9 5950X with 64 GiB RAM, Windows 11, CPU float32 and 16 Torch threads.
An unrelated adaptation experiment was running on the GPU. Small tests alternate execution
order over repeated rounds; the 1,000 and 10,000 input tests each have one full timing pair.
The similar-length control showed no regression. GPU, MPS, compiled and TileLang performance
were not measured. Results depend on input lengths, checkpoint, batch size and hardware.

To reproduce, use a fresh Python 3.12 environment and the pinned model snapshot:

```sh
python -m pip install torch==2.9.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
python -m pip install transformers==4.57.1 huggingface_hub==0.36.2 numpy==2.3.5 psutil==7.2.2
python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; print(snapshot_download('convaiinnovations/laya', revision='aa8c91ca088ec597df95a0d1c76b3063cb2ae5e8', allow_patterns=['multilingual/*']) + '/multilingual')"
```

Replace `MODEL_DIR` below with the printed checkpoint directory. Start with `--count 16
--rounds 2 --questions 3`, then increase the count. The full CPU comparison takes tens of minutes:

```sh
python research/scripts/bench_length_batching.py MODEL_DIR --count 10000 --batch-size 8 --threads 16 --rounds 1 --output length-10000.json
```

Memory measurements run each mode in a separate process after model warm-up. They sample
process RSS every 10 ms during 64-input inference, excluding model-load transients; short
allocation peaks can be missed. They do not measure the peak memory of the 10,000-input run:

```sh
python research/scripts/bench_length_batching.py MODEL_DIR --count 64 --batch-size 8 --threads 16 --memory-mode original --output memory-original.json
python research/scripts/bench_length_batching.py MODEL_DIR --count 64 --batch-size 8 --threads 16 --memory-mode grouped --output memory-grouped.json
```

## Results

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `results/t4_colab_benchmark.json` | 17,416 questions on one T4, both checkpoints, identical questions per model |
| `results/long_context_multilingual.json` | the long-document run behind `assets/long_context_8192.png`: every prediction, with device and library versions |
| `results/cpu_51_language_sweep.json` | 51 languages x 2 checkpoints, MASSIVE intent, 20 options (committed `part_b` covers the English checkpoint only; a rerun of `research/scripts/bench_local.py` writes the gitignored `research/local_benchmark_results.json` and leaves this file untouched) |
| `results/cpu_51_language_sweep_clamped.json` | the same 51 languages and 5,100 cases re-run after the temperature clamp, raw temperatures and served temperatures side by side ([#208](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/issues/208)) |
| `results/cpu_51_language_sweep_refreshed.json` | both checkpoints with the environment recorded, the superseded committed columns kept beside the new ones. The multilingual half of the committed sweep does not reproduce on current code, so this is what the table in `BENCHMARKS.md` prints ([#208](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/issues/208)) |
| `results/app_benchmark_results.json` | Applications run (400 cases per task, seed 13, 2026-09-19); source for the BENCHMARKS Themes / Jev-dataset tables and the README routed AG News / DAIR Emotion cells (a rerun of `research/scripts/bench_apps.py` writes the gitignored `research/app_benchmark_results.json` instead) |
| `research/latency_benchmark_results.json` | **not committed** (gitignored) — generate with `research/scripts/bench_latency.py`; CPU routing-cost regimes behind the README preload table |
| `results/position_sensitivity_multilingual.json` | accuracy against evidence position at fixed document length, n=20 per cell, every prediction kept |

## Headline findings

**Position matters as much as length, and `bench_long_context.py` samples exactly one position.**
That script always appends the request to the end of the filler, so it measures a single point on
the position axis. Sweeping the request through a **fixed-length** document instead
(`bench_position_sensitivity.py`, the same 20 requests and the same construction, so `position=1.0`
is the cell `bench_long_context.py` reports) gives, at `max_len=8192` with nothing truncated:

| filler tokens | pos 0.00 | pos 0.25 | pos 0.50 | pos 0.75 | pos 1.00 | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4,000 | 0.850 | 0.550 | 0.650 | 0.600 | **0.950** | 0.400 |
| 7,000 | **0.850** | 0.550 | 0.500 | 0.650 | **0.400** | 0.450 |

The **majority-class rate of this item set is 0.450** (`billing` 9, `technical` 7, `sales` 4,
`other` 0) — so the interior of the document sits at the floor, where a model that always answered
`billing` would score the same. A request placed next to the option markers (`pos 0.00`) or, at
4,000 tokens, at the very end (`pos 1.00`), is answered at 0.85–0.95.

**Which end is best depends on length**, so a pad-only sweep cannot see the shape at all: `pos 1.00`
is the *best* cell at 4,000 tokens (0.950) and the *worst* at 7,000 (0.400). Paired on the same 20
items, the interior is significantly worse than an endpoint in both cases — `pos 1.00` vs `pos 0.25`
at 4,000 tokens is 0 wrong→right / 8 right→wrong (exact McNemar p=0.0078), and `pos 0.00` vs
`pos 0.25` at 7,000 is 0 / 6 (p=0.031).

*Caveat: n=20 per cell, so each cell carries a ±0.22 95 % interval and the ordering of the interior
cells is not resolvable. The endpoint-versus-interior gap is well outside that, and the paired tests
above are on the same items. Read this as "position is a large effect that the existing sweep does
not sample", not as a per-cell ranking.*

**Routing takes Laya from 23 to 48 of 51 languages.** On MASSIVE intent (20 options, random =
0.050) the English checkpoint macro-averages 0.227 and clears 3x random on 23 of 51 languages;
the multilingual checkpoint reaches 0.401 and clears it on 48. The multilingual figures are the
re-run, not the committed sweep — see `results/cpu_51_language_sweep_refreshed.json` below.

**The English checkpoint's confidence gives no warning when it cannot read the input.** Khmer:
0.000 accuracy at 0.952 mean confidence — that is the *raw* temperature; as served, after the
#42 clamp, it is 0.705 at the same 0.000 accuracy. Macro ECE 0.733 across 51 languages as
committed (0.571 as served), with mean confidence never dropping below 0.885 raw, or 0.621 as
served, at any accuracy level. This is why routing has to happen *before* the forward pass — confidence gating cannot
catch it.

**Both checkpoints ship over-confident.** Refitting one temperature per (question type, option
count) on held-out data moves mean ECE 0.466 -> 0.081 (`laya`) and 0.314 -> 0.106
(`laya-multilingual`, which ships with no fitted temperatures at all).

**The base checkpoints are near chance on typed-decisions zero-shot** — 0.362 and 0.352 against
a 0.318 random baseline and a 0.461 majority-class baseline. The published 0.766 belongs to the
checkpoint fine-tuned on that benchmark's own training split.

**Speed.** 32.8 ms for one question and 7.2 ms/question at batch 10 on a T4; 103–332 questions/s
batched.

## On comparisons with Jev

For the original upstream suites listed above, **Jev was not run directly**. Their Jev
figures are third-party published, with different sample sizes and prompts. The separate
community diagnostic linked above includes paired API responses and documents its own limitations:

- [AbdelStark/jev-benchmarks](https://github.com/AbdelStark/jev-benchmarks) — AG News 0.910,
  Banking77 0.870, DAIR Emotion 0.480 (Brier 0.846, NLL 5.588, zero probability on the true label
  for 16% of examples)
- [nibzard/decision-model-benchmark](https://github.com/nibzard/decision-model-benchmark) — ECE
  0.246 (worst in that study), banking77 0.763, option-order flip rate 13%, latency 264–276 ms p50

Treat those as indicative, not a controlled head-to-head.
