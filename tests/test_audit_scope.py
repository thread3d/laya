"""The CVE audit job must see every name the package declares, not just the core five.

`.github/workflows/security.yml` builds its audit lists from `pyproject.toml` and hands them to
`pip-audit`. For a while it did that with a regex anchored on `dependencies = [`, which matches the
`[project]` array and none of `[project.optional-dependencies]` -- so the ten names behind the
`serve`, `fast`, `mcp`, `structured`, `onnx`, `langchain` and `langgraph` extras, and the 57
transitive names they pull in, were outside the audit. `Dockerfile` ends with
`pip install ".[serve]" && pip check`: the HTTP server's dependencies ship in the published image.

Since #645/#646 the audit is split in two. The blocking scope is what ships: the core plus the
`[serve]` extra, audited strictly, where a finding fails the job. The remaining optional
integrations are audited in a second, advisory step: findings are reported as an annotation but do
not fail unrelated PRs, while a failure of the audit itself -- a specifier pip-audit cannot
resolve, a resolver or tool crash -- still does.

Text parsing, not tomllib: the floor is 3.10 and tomllib arrives in 3.11, same as
`tests/test_packaging.py`. The job that runs the extractor pins `python-version: "3.11"`, which is
checked here, and the lifted code is only executed where tomllib exists -- on 3.10 that check
degrades to a note and never to a pass.
