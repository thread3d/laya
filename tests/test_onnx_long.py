"""ONNXAgent.predict_long: the long-document API the PyTorch Agent has and ONNX did not.

`Agent.predict_long` windows a state that exceeds the context budget, scores the windows through
`predict_batch`, and aggregates per question. `ONNXAgent` had neither method, so the documented
long-state recipe was torch-only. Like `tests/test_onnx_batch.py`, this runs with no onnxruntime
and no checkpoint: the class is built with `__new__`, a fake tokenizer and a stub session whose
logits derive from each row's own tokens, so a window decoded for the wrong span changes the
answer and fails these checks.

    #692 added this comparison so a start hook's questions drive aggregation: an added decision must
    not disappear, a rename must not `KeyError`, a type change must apply the right rule. All of that
    lives in `answers`, and all of it is asserted exactly as before.

    What is exempted is `usage.windows`, and only in the safe direction. Windowing happens BEFORE the
    hook chain -- it has to, because a start hook is documented to see and rewrite `ctx.states`, i.e.
    the windows themselves -- so the scan is sized from the questions the caller passed. When a hook
    then LEAVES MORE room than the scan was sized for, the scan is finer than it needed to be: every
    token is still covered, the answers are identical, and the only difference is that more passes
    were made. Measured on the ONNX fixture for the `clear` rewrite: 14 windows against 6, with
    identical `answers`. The torch fixture happens to produce 8 either way, so it passed the
    whole-dict comparison by luck rather than by construction.

    The other direction is not exempted and is not silent: a hook that leaves LESS room than the scan
    was sized for is refused outright by `_check_scan_budget`, because then the windows really would be
    re-truncated and part of the document would reach no model. That refusal has its own checks, and it
    is why this exemption is one-sided in practice rather than by assertion here -- an earlier revision
    of this helper also asserted `hooked >= direct`, which reads like a guarantee and cannot fail:
    the only route to a coarser hooked scan is a shrinking rewrite, and that is refused before it can
    be observed. Removed rather than kept as decoration.
