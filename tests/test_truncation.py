"""State truncation must be reported from the token budget that actually applies (issue #174).

`build_sequence` clamps the state to whatever room the head leaves, and before this the clamp was
silent: `system_one` returned a token count and nothing about what it had dropped. A caller could
only guess, and the guess reported in #174 - a fixed character threshold - is wrong in both
directions, because the budget is in tokens and moves with `max_len`, `head_max_len` and the
rendered head of each question.

These use a stub tokenizer (one token per whitespace word) so they run offline and the expected
token counts are exact, the same approach as tests/test_shortlist.py.
