    `answer_confidence` is `max(p)` -- the probability mass on the answer being reported. It is
    the quantity temperature scaling fits, the quantity every calibration figure in this
    repository is computed on, and the quantity the `min_confidence` gate is defined against
    (#361). That makes it the right number for a threshold a caller compares against; it is
    not on its own a claim that the number is right. Reading it as "about c of the answers
    returned at c are correct" holds only after temperatures have been fitted and validated on
    held-out data for that checkpoint and question shape -- the shipped checkpoints are
    over-confident as shipped, and `laya-multilingual` ships with no fitted temperatures at all
    (README, Calibration). `common.answer_confidence` states the quantity; this states when it
    carries that property.

    `confidence` is a different quantity on a different scale -- normalized entropy, which
    `common.confidence_from_probs` calls "not calibrated" and #394 says does not transfer across
    option counts. So this deliberately does **not** fall back to it: reporting the entropy
    number under the `answer_confidence` name would be worse than reporting nothing, because the
    name is what a caller filters on.

    A `bool` is not a confidence and a NaN is not a decision, so both give None rather than 0.0.
