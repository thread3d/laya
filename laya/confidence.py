    the quantity temperature scaling fits, the quantity every calibration figure in this
    repository is computed on, and the quantity the `min_confidence` gate is defined against
    (#361). That makes it the right number for a threshold a caller compares against; it is
    not on its own a claim that the number is right. Reading it as "about c of the answers
    returned at c are correct" holds only after temperatures have been fitted and validated on
    held-out data for that checkpoint and question shape -- the shipped checkpoints are
    over-confident as shipped, and `laya-multilingual` ships with no fitted temperatures at all
    (README, Calibration). `common.answer_confidence` states the quantity; this states when it
    carries that property.

    `confidence` is a different quantity on a different scale -- normalized entropy, which
    `common.confidence_from_probs` calls "not calibrated" and #394 says does not transfer across
    option counts. So this deliberately does **not** fall back to it: reporting the entropy
    number under the `answer_confidence` name would be worse than reporting nothing, because the
    name is what a caller filters on.

    A gate is a policy, and a policy whose application cannot be observed is not one. With

    answer, plus ``abstention_threshold``, so a caller can answer three questions it otherwise
    cannot:

    * what fraction of decisions abstained, rather than inferring it from whether
      ``low_confidence`` happened to be set;
    * how many answers the gate could not decide on, which a boolean cannot express at all;
    * what threshold produced these results -- ``flag_low_confidence`` consumes the threshold and
      drops it, so without this a batch run with per-class thresholds cannot be re-split.

    ``GATE_UNEVALUATED`` is the case a boolean cannot express: the gate ran and the answer carried
    no usable confidence, so the gate could not decide. Reporting that as a pass is the same lie
    as reporting it as a flag.

    **With `min_confidence` unset, this writes nothing.** No ``abstention``, no
    ``abstention_threshold``, no flag. That is the whole contract: an ungated call returns exactly
    the payload it returned before, and the presence of the field -- not a fourth value read out
    of it -- is what tells a caller the gate ran. Call it unconditionally, once per call, in place
    of an `if min_confidence is not None:` guard: that guard is what leaves a path reporting
    nothing at all, which is the state this function exists to distinguish.

    The flag itself stays :func:`flag_low_confidence`'s -- this delegates rather than
    re-implementing the rule, so the boolean and the reported state cannot drift apart.

    A `min_confidence` of exactly ``0.0`` *was* set, so states are reported, and
    :func:`flag_low_confidence` treats ``0.0`` as a no-op because nothing can fall below it. Every
    answer carrying a usable confidence therefore reads ``passed``, and the threshold echo is what
    distinguishes that from a real pass at a real threshold.
