"""Route a request to the Laya checkpoint best suited to it.

Three checkpoints, measured on a shared benchmark (17,416 questions, one T4, identical questions
per model -- see the repository's benchmark notebook):

  english          convaiinnovations/laya                421M  ModernBERT-large, 512 tokens
  multilingual     convaiinnovations/laya-multilingual   322M  mmBERT-base, 1024 tokens, 100+ langs
  typed-decisions  convaiinnovations/laya-typed-decisions 421M  ModernBERT-large, 1024 tokens,
                                                                fine-tuned on the typed-decisions
                                                                workflows

Why routing is worth it -- accuracy by language family:

                      english   multilingual
  MASSIVE intent  en    0.783       0.657        <- English checkpoint wins
  MASSIVE intent  non-en 0.306      0.451
  XNLI            en    0.860       0.843
  XNLI            non-en 0.521      0.731        <- +21 points for multilingual
  English suites        0.684       0.619

The English checkpoint does not gently degrade off English, it collapses: on 20-option MASSIVE
intent it scores 0.100 on Hindi and 0.103 on Korean, against 0.050 for random guessing -- and it
reports high confidence while doing so (ECE 0.855 on Hindi). Script detection is therefore the
primary routing signal.

`typed-decisions` is never selected automatically unless you opt in with
`auto_task_detection=True` or pass `task="typed_decisions"`: it is fine-tuned on four specific
synthetic workflows and should not be a silent default.

    which for a *nested* variable would otherwise be read as an artifact map and raise
    `cannot verify 'english': no such file` on a checkpoint the variable never named.

    A value that is not a mapping is handed on untouched, so `verify_digests` keeps ownership of the
    "expected_sha256 must be a mapping" message rather than this layer growing a second copy.

    The two channels are merged file by file, because each names files and a digest is a claim about
    one file -- dropping either half would verify less than the caller asked for. **For a file both
    name, the per-checkpoint entry wins.** They are not equally specific: `shared` reaches every
    checkpoint, and `model.safetensors` is the one name every checkpoint uses for a *different* file,
    so a shared entry for it cannot be a correct claim about all of them at once. Refusing that
    overlap as a contradiction broke the ordinary shape it appears in -- a shared pin plus a
    per-checkpoint override, which loaded correctly before this function existed.

    An empty placeholder therefore needs no special case: merging it changes nothing.

class Router(HookRegistry):
    """Lazily loads Laya checkpoints and sends each request to the right one.

        from laya import Router

        r = Router()
        r.predict({"message": "Mein Konto wurde zweimal belastet"}, questions)   # -> multilingual
        r.predict({"message": "I was charged twice"}, questions)                 # -> english
        r.predict(state, questions, model="typed-decisions")                     # explicit

    Models are downloaded and built on first use. `max_loaded` caps how many stay resident
    (least-recently-used is evicted), because all three together are ~1.16B parameters.

    The default is 2, because automatic routing only ever chooses between `english` and
    `multilingual`: a cap of one rebuilds the checkpoint it just evicted on every script switch,
    which is seconds per request on exactly the traffic the Router exists for. Traffic that only
    ever sees one language never builds the second checkpoint, so the default costs it nothing.
    Lower it to 1 for a memory-constrained host, and raise it to 3 (or preload) when
    `auto_task_detection`, an explicit `model=` or an explicit `task=` can reach
    `typed-decisions` as well.

    For a server or a demo, preload instead: a cold load costs seconds, while detection costs
    microseconds, so even the default still pays a load the first time a language appears.

        r = Router(preload=True)                    # all three resident, routing is free
        r = Router(preload=True, device="cuda")
        r.preload(["english", "multilingual"])      # or just the two you serve

    Hub revisions are opt-in. `revision` applies one commit to every model;
    `revisions={"english": "...", "multilingual": "..."}` overrides that per model,
    which is useful when standalone repositories were reviewed at different commits.
    Without either, huggingface_hub's normal default and existing offline cache are used.

    A `revisions` entry that is `None` or blank is "no override for this model", so the model
    inherits `revision` -- the shape `{"english": os.environ.get("EN_SHA")}` writes when the
    variable is unset, which must not cost the caller the pin it did ask for. Nothing in
    `revisions` can unpin one model while `revision` pins the rest; leave `revision` unset and
    name the models you want pinned instead.

    A blank `revision` is read the same way, which is a deliberate change in what the Router
    passes on: `Router(revision="   ")` used to reach `resolve_revision`, where a truthy but blank
    string suppressed the `LAYA_REVISION` fallback and left huggingface_hub's default, and is now
    dropped before it gets there, so a Router configured with whitespace behaves like one
    configured with nothing and `$LAYA_REVISION` applies. That is what "this configuration line was
    never filled in" has to mean if `revision` and a `revisions` entry are to be read the same way.

    It is one of two places a weaker source ends up ahead of an explicit argument. The other is a
    per-checkpoint digest entry from `LAYA_SHA256_DIGESTS`, which wins over an `expected_sha256`
    passed through `agent_kwargs`; see the class docstring.

    Anything else `laya.Agent` accepts is reachable through `agent_kwargs`, which is merged into
    every checkpoint the Router builds:

        Router(agent_kwargs={"lang_temperatures": {"de": {"temperature": [1.0, 1.4, 2.0]}}})
        Router(agent_kwargs={"expected_sha256": {"model.safetensors": "a3f1..."}})
        Router(agent_kwargs={"fast": True})

    `expected_sha256` there pins the same files on every checkpoint, which is what a single
    resident checkpoint or a shared `tokenizer.json` wants. It is never discarded wholesale by a
    checkpoint's own digests: where one also has an entry, from `sha256_digests` or from a
    **per-checkpoint** `LAYA_SHA256_DIGESTS`, the two maps are merged **file by file**, so a file
    only one of them names is still verified.

    Two exceptions, both deliberate and both tested, because "merged file by file" is not the whole
    story and the difference is a supply-chain control:

    * A **flat** `LAYA_SHA256_DIGESTS` -- `{artifact: digest}` rather than `{model: {...}}` -- is
      not a layer here at all. `verify_digests` applies it itself, but only when nothing else pins
      (`if expected is None`), so ANY `expected_sha256` reaching `Agent`, from here or from a
      checkpoint entry, means the flat variable is not consulted for that load. Verified on real
      files: a flat variable pinning `model.safetensors` plus an `agent_kwargs` map pinning
      `tokenizer.json` loads a tampered `model.safetensors`. Use the per-checkpoint shape, or name
      every file you care about in one map, if you need both. This is unchanged from `main`.
    * An explicit `{}` or `None` entry MASKS what would otherwise apply -- that is what "load this
      one unverified" has to mean, and `test_an_explicit_none_entry_masks_a_flat_environment_map`
      pins it.

    And the precedence is per-checkpoint over shared regardless of where each came from, so a
    per-checkpoint entry synthesised from `LAYA_SHA256_DIGESTS` wins over an `expected_sha256`
    passed here in code. An environment variable beating an explicit argument is worth stating
    plainly on a control like this; `test_an_environment_pin_overrides_the_shared_one_per_checkpoint`
    is where that is pinned.

    For a file both name, the per-checkpoint entry wins. The two are not equally specific: the
    `agent_kwargs` map reaches every checkpoint the Router builds, and `model.safetensors` is the one
    name every checkpoint uses for a *different* file, so a shared entry for it cannot be a correct
    claim about all of them at once. **Nothing raises over that overlap** -- refusing it would reject
    a shared pin plus a per-checkpoint override, which is the ordinary shape and which loaded
    correctly before any of this existed. If you need to know which digest a checkpoint was verified
    against, read it back: the map handed to each `Agent` is the merge described above.

    Both `agent_kwargs` and `sha256_digests` are public and mutable, and a checkpoint's entry is read
    on the load rather than at construction, so a pin assigned afterwards -- or added to an
    existing entry in place -- counts.

    The names the Router sets for itself -- `model_id_or_path`, `device`, `token`, `subfolder`,
    `revision` and the hook arguments -- are refused here rather than silently shadowed, and the
    remaining names are checked against `Agent.__init__` at construction, so a misspelled option
    fails on the `Router(...)` line instead of on the first request.

    Artifact digests are opt-in and always per model: `sha256_digests={"english": {...}}`
    passes that `{path relative to the checkpoint dir: hexdigest}` map to the `Agent` that
    loads it, so a tampered or substituted weight file is refused before it is parsed. There
    is no Router-wide equivalent of `revision` because digests, unlike a commit SHA, are not
    shareable: the bundled repository ships a separate `model.safetensors` for each of
    `english`, `multilingual` and `typed-decisions`, so one flat map can only ever match one
    of them. A model listed with `None` or `{}` adds no files of its own, which loads it
    unverified unless `agent_kwargs["expected_sha256"]` pins it; it still masks a flat
    `LAYA_SHA256_DIGESTS`, which is what listing it that way is for.

    The same split is available to a process configured only by environment: when
    `LAYA_SHA256_DIGESTS` holds a model-keyed map (`{"english": {...}, "multilingual": {...}}`)
    this seeds it per checkpoint, so a server that keeps several resident can pin each with its
    own digests instead of refusing to start on the second one. A flat `LAYA_SHA256_DIGESTS`
    keeps its existing meaning, applied by `laya.revisions` to every checkpoint the process
    loads, which is right for a single-checkpoint one. An argument entry wins over the
    environment for the model it names. A nested variable that names some checkpoints and not
    others says nothing about the others: they keep whatever `agent_kwargs["expected_sha256"]`
    pins them with, because pinning one checkpoint from the environment is not a request to stop
    verifying the rest.

    Hooks are opt-in and run at the Router level: `on_route` sees the routing decision,
    `on_load` / `on_evict` see model lifecycle, and `on_predict_start` / `on_predict_end`
    wrap the whole route+infer call. See `laya.hooks`.

        `predict` scores a state from a single window: anything past `max_len` is cut off (the
        first window, or for a conversation list the last) and never reaches the model. This
        routes exactly as `predict` does -- the same `model`/`task`/`lang` hints, the same
        router-level hooks, the same `routing` key and `usage` -- and scores the routed state with
        that agent's `predict_long`, which splits it into overlapping windows and aggregates per
        question. The aggregation rules are `laya.agent.Agent.predict_long`'s: `noul` takes the
        strongest window, `choice`/`score` the most confident one.

        Per-call hooks (`hooks`, `on_predict_start`, `on_predict_end`, `hooks_raise`,
        `hooks_timeout`) wrap the whole route+scan exactly as they wrap `predict`: the scan runs
        last, so a start hook that answers (`ctx.skip(...)`) or rewrites the state wins.
        `max_len` / `head_max_len` are not accepted here -- a window is sized by `window` or the
        checkpoint budget, and overriding the single-window truncation is what `predict_long` is for.

        Args:
            window: state tokens per window. Defaults to the routed checkpoint's budget
                    (`max(64, max_len - head_max_len - 8)`; the 64 is a floor), capped at the room
                    the questions leave for the state so no window is truncated again on the way
                    in; a smaller window isolates a localized span.
            stride: token step between windows; defaults to half the effective window (50%
                    overlap). A stride past that window is a `ValueError`, since the tokens between
                    windows would reach no model.
            aggregate: "auto" (the per-type rules above) is the only mode.
            batch_size: cap on windows per forward pass, to bound memory on very long states.

        Returns:
            The usual `predict` payload, with `usage["windows"]` counting the windows scored.

        Raises:
            TypeError: the routed agent has no `predict_long` -- one attached by hand, since both
                    `Agent` and `ONNXAgent` implement it -- so there is nothing to scan with.
                    Always raised, whatever `hooks_raise` is, and so is every other error the scan
                    itself raises -- none are caught: the scan is this method's own work, not a
                    caller's hook, so the hook error policy does not decide whether it may be
                    skipped. It previously ran as a start hook, where `hooks_raise=False` swallowed
                    this and returned one window scored by `system_one` -- a different question than
                    the one asked. An agent whose `predict_long` has no `lang` parameter is scanned
                    without one and warned about, not failed; that is a signature check, not a

        """Route and execute a heterogeneous request batch with minimal model churn.

        Requests are routed first and grouped by checkpoint. Within each checkpoint,
        requests that share the same question schema are passed to
        ``Agent.predict_batch`` so their states can share forward passes. Results are
        then restored to the original request order.

        Requests may independently specify ``model``, ``task``, ``lang``,
        ``lang_guess``, ``max_len`` or ``head_max_len`` and may use different question schemas.
        ``max_len`` / ``head_max_len`` are the per-request form of the token-budget override
        ``predict`` takes as call arguments: they set the checkpoint's state and question-head
        budgets for that one request, so a wide question can be asked without shrinking the
        batch's other requests to the same window. Requests that ask for different budgets are
        split into separate forward passes, since one ``Agent.predict_batch`` call carries one
        budget for all its states. A start hook may still replace either value on ``ctx``.

        Router-level predict hooks run per request, as ``predict`` runs them: each request
        gets its own ``PredictContext``, so ``on_predict_start`` can replace that request's
        state, questions or token budget, or ``ctx.skip(...)`` it, and ``on_predict_end``
        sees and may replace its result. Requests are grouped for the forward pass after
        their start hooks have run, and a checkpoint group's requests end in reverse of the
        order they started. If a checkpoint group fails, every request of it whose start hook
        ran fails with the exception, a cache hit included: each gets ``on_error`` and then
        ``on_predict_end`` before the exception propagates.

        Args:
            requests: Sequence of request dictionaries. Every item requires ``state`` and
                ``questions`` and may include ``model``, ``task``, ``lang`` or
                ``lang_guess`` routing overrides and ``max_len`` / ``head_max_len`` token-budget
                overrides.
            batch_size: Optional maximum number of states per Agent forward-pass batch.
            hooks_timeout: Override the Router's ``hooks_timeout`` for this call.
            min_confidence: Optional float or per-bucket mapping for confidence gating.
            sort_by_length: Forwarded to every ``Agent.predict_batch`` call, so each question
                group pads to a shorter maximum; see ``Agent.predict_batch``. Results retain the
                input order either way. Silently dropped for an attached agent whose
                ``predict_batch`` predates the knob (#294).
            hooks (HookArg): Per-call hook or sequence of hooks for this call.
            on_predict_start (PredictHookArg): Plain callable or sequence of callables for start events.
            on_predict_end (PredictHookArg): Plain callable or sequence of callables for end events.
            hooks_raise: Override the Router's ``hooks_raise`` policy for this call.

        Returns:
            One normal Router prediction result per request, in the same order as the input.
