"""Per-call decision controls shared by the framework integrations.

Every integration wrapper ends at one of two places: a local `runner.predict(state, questions,
**overrides)` call, or a POST to a laya-serve node. Which overrides those two accept is a single
rule, and three independent copies of it drift -- this module is the copy the LangChain, CrewAI
and LlamaIndex wrappers import.

The names are listed once, in `PREDICT_CONTROLS` and `HOOK_CONTROLS`, and the signatures below
are checked against them by `tests/test_langchain.py`, `tests/test_crewai.py` and
`tests/test_llamaindex.py`, which also assert every wrapper's constructor accepts all of them. A
control added here without reaching a wrapper's `__init__` fails that wrapper's suite rather than
being dropped silently.
