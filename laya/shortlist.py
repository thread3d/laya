"""Opt-in embedding shortlist and tournament for high-cardinality choice questions.

Choice options share one ``head_max_len`` budget, so a large label set leaves only a few
tokens per label. ``predict_shortlist`` embeds the state and each option with a
caller-supplied ``embed_fn``, keeps the top ``k``, and runs a single ``predict`` (or
``system_one``) on that reduced criteria set. ``predict_tournament`` needs no embedder: the
decision model answers the labels in groups small enough to keep their tokens, and the group
winners meet in one more ``predict``.

``Agent.predict`` and ``Agent.system_one`` are separate: they still score every criterion
they are given. This module does not change ``DecisionModel.forward``.
``predict_shortlist`` adds no second decision-model pass; ``predict_tournament`` adds one
per elimination round.

The coarse-to-fine pattern is the one the README recommends and the one reported in
https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/issues/102. Ranking here is cosine similarity on
whatever vectors ``embed_fn`` returns. Issue #102's BANKING77 figures belong to that
report; this module does not measure them.
