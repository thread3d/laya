    `state_ids` lets a caller tokenize the shared state once and reuse it across every question,
    instead of re-serializing and re-tokenizing the same document per question.

    `return_stats` adds a third return value describing what the head budget did to the options:
    `options` (how many the question defines), `options_distinct` (how many still have a token
    span of their own) and `tokens_per_option` (the cap applied to each, or None when none was).

    stats when both are asked for, reporting that clamp:

        {"state_tokens": int, "state_tokens_used": int, "state_tokens_dropped": int,

    Callers cannot reconstruct this from the outside. The budget is in tokens, not characters,

    the rendered options - so it moves per checkpoint and per question. A caller guessing with a
    fixed character threshold is wrong in both directions: it reports truncation that did not
    happen, and stays silent while evidence is being dropped (issue #174).

    The question half is `build_head`; `state_room` reports how much of `max_len` is left for the
    state after it, which is what a caller must size a window against.
