"""HTTP server exposing Laya over TypeSafe Jev's ``/v1/systemone`` wire protocol.

Laya's ``predict()`` output is already schema-compatible with the Jev decision
API -- ``choice`` / ``score`` / ``noul`` answers and a ``{input_tokens,
output_tokens}`` usage block -- so a client written against Jev (for example the
`hs-jev` Haskell client) can point its ``baseUrl`` at this server and keep
working unchanged. All this module adds is the HTTP surface Laya itself does not
ship: a ``POST /v1/systemone`` route, an optional bearer check, and a health
probe.

Configuration is entirely via environment variables so the same entry point
serves a laptop dev run and a systemd unit:

=========================  ============================================  =========
env var                    meaning                                        default

``LAYA_PORT``              bind port                                      8000
``LAYA_DEVICE``            torch device for every checkpoint              (auto)
``LAYA_PRELOAD``           build the checkpoints at startup, not lazily   1
``LAYA_MODELS``            comma list to preload (english,multilingual,   (all)
                           typed-decisions); empty = every checkpoint

                           Keep <= physical cores; oversubscribing the     default)
                           logical/hyperthread count is a large regression.
``LAYA_AUTO_TASK``         auto-route to the typed-decisions checkpoint   0
``LAYA_MAX_LOADED``        checkpoints kept resident at once. Below what  2
                           routing can choose, one reloads per switch.
``LAYA_API_KEY``           if set, require ``Authorization: Bearer <it>``  (none)
``LAYA_ROOT_PATH``         public URL prefix behind a reverse proxy        (none)
``LAYA_LOG_LEVEL``         uvicorn log level                              info
``LAYA_MAX_CONCURRENT``    cap on requests past auth at once; excess      16
                           gets 503 (see below)
``LAYA_MAX_TOKEN_BUDGET``  cap on per-request max_len / head_max_len       8192
=========================  ============================================  =========

``LAYA_DEVICE`` is a preference, not a guarantee: an ``Agent`` that asks for a
GPU it cannot get falls back to CPU silently and keeps answering correctly.
``/health`` reports where a resident checkpoint actually computes, using the
same helpers the MCP status tool uses (``laya.mcp.device``).

Imports of heavy dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, torch via Router) are all
deferred into the functions that need them, so ``import laya.serve`` stays cheap
and touches no GPU -- which is what keeps the Nix ``pythonImportsCheck`` honest.

    Non-zero only when exceeding `cap` is certain, and 0 for "not proven" -- never the other way
    round, so a 0 sends the state on to the exact `json.dumps` measurement and no verdict changes.

    The value is returned rather than a bool so the 413 can quote a number something measured. It
    understates the true length (see below), so the message is a true statement about the state --
    unlike reporting `cap + 1`, which would answer "state too large (50001 > 50000 chars)" for a
    60 012-character state. That is the same fabricated-count flaw this gate replaces, and an
    earlier revision of this branch reintroduced it.

    One consequence worth knowing: the number in a 413 is therefore the exact serialized length when
    the encoder ran, and this understated bound when it did not. Both are truthful and neither
    overstates, but a client trimming exactly the difference the message names can still be refused.

    The bound: the raw lengths of the string values are a *lower* bound on the JSON length. Escaping
    maps each character to one or more characters and so never shortens; keys, separators, brackets
    and quotes only add; numbers, booleans and nulls contribute at least one character each and are
    counted as zero here. Every one of those makes this an under-estimate, which is the safe
    direction: under-estimating can only fail to refuse, and then the encoder decides.

    Why it is worth having. The dump runs before the gate refuses, so its cost is bounded by
    `MAX_BODY_BYTES` rather than by `cap`: a 2 MiB body -- the largest the streaming cap admits --
    cost 5.68 ms to serialize for a request that is then rejected, which is more than the 2.22 ms
    `json.loads` spent parsing it in the first place. Finding one 2 MiB string instead takes a single
    `len()`. Measured: 5.687 ms -> 0.0003 ms on that state, while every state that IS accepted pays
    at most 0.01 ms more (worst ratio 2.08x, on a 6 us deeply-nested case).

    `json.dumps(state, ensure_ascii=False)` for a dict or list, which the agents then strip mask
    tokens out of, and that can only shorten it. `MAX_STATE_CHARS` has to be measured on that
    text, not on `str()`, which is a different length in both directions:

    * `repr` quotes a value with `'` and leaves a `"` inside it one character, where JSON escapes
      it to the two characters `\"`. A `{"body": '"' * 49988}` state has a `len(str())` of exactly
      50000, so it passed the gate, and then serialized to 99988 -- the documented 50000-character
      limit admitting very nearly twice what it says.
    * `repr` renders a zero-width space as the six characters `\u200b` where `ensure_ascii=False`
      writes the one character it is, so a state that serializes to 8344 characters -- a sixth of
      the limit -- was refused with "state too large (50004 > 50000 chars)".

    `json.dumps` inline rather than importing `serialize_state`: `laya.common` imports torch at
    module level and `import laya.serve` must not (tests/test_lazy_import.py). The two are pinned
    to each other in tests/test_serve.py.

    Cost. At the gate's own ceiling the dump is 0.133 ms against 0.080 ms for the `str()` it
    replaces -- orders of magnitude under the forward pass that state then gets, so the serialized
    text is not worth threading through `predict()` to be encoded only once. A state large enough
    for that difference to matter never reaches the dump: `_state_length_lower_bound_over` refuses it
    first, which is what keeps an oversized body from costing more to reject than it did upstream.
