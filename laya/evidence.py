"""Read-only evidence inspection over existing Laya artifacts.

This module reports what evidence exists for a checkpoint -- and what is missing,
insufficient, or incomparable -- without loading model weights, without needing
torch, and without writing a new manifest. It only reads artifacts the upstream
train/eval path already persists:

- a checkpoint directory's ``rl_agent_config.json`` (``training.laya_train`` and
  ``training.laya_train_calibration`` as written by merged #931/#933);
- an existing ``laya-evals`` report JSON (identity semantics from `laya.evals`).

Every state it assigns is either derived directly from an upstream artifact or
marked UNKNOWN. It never manufactures a healthy-looking state from absent input.
