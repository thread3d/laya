"""Fit and persist per-bucket temperatures for Laya logits.

Ports the notebook LBFGS fitter (NLL on softmax(z/T)) and groups records by
`temp_bucket(qtype, k)` so the runtime's `temperature_by_options` lookup has a writer.
Fitting is CPU-side: records are `(qtype, logits, target, k)` and do not load Hub weights.

Two sample floors, on purpose:

- `MIN_BUCKET_N` is the per-bucket floor. Buckets with fewer examples are omitted from
  `temperature_by_options`; the type-level scalar covers them at lookup time.
- `MIN_TYPE_N` is the lower floor used only for that type-level scalar. It stays at the
  previous floor of 10 so a realistic dataset that fills no single bucket still gets a
  temperature instead of remaining at 1.0. Do not raise it to `MIN_BUCKET_N`.

Fitted temperatures go through `clamp_temperature` and therefore `[TEMP_MIN, TEMP_MAX]`
from `laya.common`, the same guard checkpoint load uses. There is no second pair of
bounds in this module.

    Those are the three fields this reads and the three it writes. `binning_map` is installed
    whatever the payload holds, including nothing: a payload with no ``binning_map`` key -- every
    file written before histogram binning existed, and every agent that saved before
    :meth:`Agent.fit_binning` ran -- installs `None`, which clears a map this object already
    fitted. The file is the whole calibration state, not a patch onto the current one.

    A missing `version` is version 1 (temperatures only, no checkpoint identity). Version
    `CALIBRATION_VERSION` records the checkpoint the map was fitted for; a mismatch warns
    and still loads, so an older file never becomes a hard failure. Each temperature is passed
    through `clamp_temperature`, so a non-numeric or out-of-range entry cannot crash a later
    forward the way an unclamped zero used to.

    `temperature` and `binning_map` take opposite value policies, and that is the sentence to read
    before writing a file by hand: a bad *temperature* is forgiven and clamped into
    `[TEMP_MIN, TEMP_MAX]`, while a bad *binning value* is refused. Nothing recalibrates a
    confidence the way an out-of-range binning value would, so there is no defensible fallback
    for it.

    The payload's *shape* is checked before any of that, and refused with a `ValueError` naming
    the field: the values may be junk the clamp forgives, but the payload itself not being an
    object, a `version` that is not an integer, a `temperature` that is not a list of three, a
    `temperature_by_options` that is not an object, a `binning_map` that is not an object, or a
    `binning_map` entry that is not an object with an integer `bins` >= 1 and `values` of exactly
    that length holding finite numbers in [0, 1] is a file this code cannot read -- JSON gives
    `int`, `str`, `list` and `dict` for each of those mistakes just as happily as it gives the
    right shapes, and each used to fail with a raw `TypeError`/`AttributeError` from
    `len()`/`dict()`, or worse, to load: a `{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}` or `"abc"` has `len` 3 and
