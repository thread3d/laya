    Five things a caller should be ready for:

      3. a `choice` question with empty criteria   -> ValueError naming it, before the model runs;
      4. a question whose options do not fit       -> ValueError, but only once they overflow;
      5. a `noul` whose probability is near 0.5    -> a perfectly ordinary answer, not an error.

    Cases 1 and 2 are cheap and run first. Everything after that uses the English checkpoint.
