"""Example 15 -- what happens when the state does not fit.

Builds a document whose key facts sit at the start and at the end, prints the checkpoint's
window, and shows that truncation keeps the head: the start question is answered and the
end question is not. Then reads the `usage` report that says so, because the answers do not.

    Every call gets a fixed window: `max_len` tokens for the whole sequence, of which the
    question text and its options may take up to `head_max_len`. The state gets what is
    left, and a state longer than that is cut down to its head. The answers do not say so;
    the usage report does.

    The document below is a long case file with one key fact in its first sentence and a
    different key fact in its closing line. Two questions are asked about it -- one whose
    evidence is at the very start, one whose evidence is at the very end -- and the second
    one has nothing to read.
