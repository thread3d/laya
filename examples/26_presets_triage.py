    `triage_questions()` is a ready-made schema for inbound support: five questions, one
    forward pass. It mixes all three primitives -- a multi-way choice, two yes/no
    probabilities, and an ordinal score -- so a single call fills a whole triage record.

    months, had tickets ignored, and threatens to leave. Every field except `is_urgent`
    comes back decisive.
