"""Example 04 -- routing with a choice question.

A `choice` question offers a closed set of labels; Laya returns the winner plus a
probability for every label, all from one forward pass. Nothing is generated, so there
is no text to parse and no label it can invent outside the `criteria` map.

    A `choice` question gives the model a fixed set of labels. `criteria` is a
    label -> description map: each key becomes one answer option and its description
    tells the model what that label means. The answer then carries the chosen label, a
    probability for every label, and two confidence numbers: `answer_confidence` (max(p),
    the number to gate on -- example 18 routes at a threshold on it) and `confidence`.

    `confidence` is not the top probability: it is the normalised entropy of the whole
    distribution, 1 - H(p) / log(k), so it rewards one option clearly beating the rest.

    Watch `department` follow the description map. The duplicate charge lands in
    billing; a checkout returning 500s lands in technical.
