"""Example 03 -- reading the result of a predict() call.

A guided tour of what `predict()` returns: the three top-level keys, the `answers` dict
keyed by question id, the fields of each of the three answer types, and what `usage` means.
This is the example to come back to when writing your own glue code.

banner("03", "Reading the result", """
    Every `predict()` call returns one plain dict with three keys:

        {"model": "laya-rl-agent",
         "answers": {<question id>: <answer>, ...},
         "usage": {"input_tokens": <batch total>, "output_tokens": 0,
                   "state_tokens": <the whole state>, "state_tokens_dropped": <worst case>,
                   "truncated": <bool>, "truncated_questions": [<question id>, ...]}}

    `answers` is keyed by the ids you chose, so glue code can index it directly instead of
    zipping a list back onto the questions. Each answer carries a `type` matching its
    question, the typed decision fields, a `confidence` and an `answer_confidence`, and an
    `action` payload.

    `usage` is the part readers misread: `input_tokens` is the whole batch, with the state
    counted once per question, so it grows with the number of questions rather than being a
    context length. `output_tokens` is always 0 -- Laya never generates text. The keys after
    them are how much of your state the model actually read: `state_tokens` is the whole
    serialized state, `state_tokens_dropped` the most of it any one question's head gave up,
    and `truncated` / `truncated_questions` name the questions that gave something up. One more
    key, `options`, appears only when the head budget was tight enough to leave some question's
    options sharing a token span -- that question can no longer tell those options apart, and
    `usage["options"]` is where the call says so.
