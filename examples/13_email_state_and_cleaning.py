    `laya.email_state(subject, body, sender)` returns a state dict and, by default,
    runs `clean_email_body()` over the body first. That helper drops quoted history
    (everything from an "On ... wrote:" header), lines starting with ">", trailing
    signature blocks, and confidentiality disclaimers.

    Cleaning is worth watching rather than trusting. Below, the same questions run
    against the cleaned state and the raw body of the same message. The first message
    is legitimate and both agree; the second is a phishing lure wrapped in a harmless
    quoted reply, and the raw body pulls the answer to the wrong team.

I need help with invoice 4411. Our finance system shows two separate captures for the
same order, and the card statement confirms both of them landed on the same day.

The order was placed for a single keyboard and a couple of cables, so the second charge
looks like a duplicate rather than a legitimate renewal.

Could you please reverse the duplicate charge and confirm by email once the refund has
been issued? I have attached the statement excerpt below for reference.
