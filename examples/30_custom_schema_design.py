"""Example 30 -- writing your own question schema.

The presets are fixed schemas; this builds a four-question bug-triage schema from scratch
as ordinary Python, runs it on two contrasting reports, then takes the design apart --

banner("30", "Designing a question schema", """
    A preset is just a Python dict: a question id, a `type`, an `instructions` string and
    (for choice and score) `criteria`. Writing your own is therefore API design, not a
    model change -- the same checkpoint answers whatever you ask, in the same one forward
    pass.

    The schema below triages inbound bug reports on four axes:

      category        choice   what kind of bug is it?
      severity        score    how bad is it, on an ordered scale?
      reproducible    noul     can an engineer reproduce it?
      data_loss_risk  noul     might data be lost or corrupted?

    It runs on a cosmetic UI report and on a crash that corrupts saved data; the design
    notes afterwards use the values that actually came back.
